# Harmonic

![Harmonic bot icon](assets/bot-icon.png)

Harmonic is one node in the 13-bot Discord music fleet. Tuned for chill, blended listening sessions. It owns its queue tables, reports playback state to the shared swarm database, and is controlled directly from Discord, Aria, and SwarmPanel.

## Identity

- Discord display name: **GWS Music Bot (Harmonic)**
- Internal node name: `harmonic`
- Command namespace: `/harmonic_main_*`

## What It Does

- Plays links, playlists, search results, and livestreams through Lavalink, picking the best available audio quality.
- Persists the live queue, backup queue, current track, requester, playtime, and recovery state to MySQL.
- Restores playback automatically from database state after disconnects, restarts, or voice connection stalls.
- Uses smooth fade logic with many small volume steps instead of a low-volume pause followed by a jump, with optional "smart" fade timing based on track length and active filters.
- Applies audio filters (nightcore, vaporwave, bass boost, and more) by replacing active filters instead of stacking them.
- Supports temporary per-track speed/pitch modifiers that automatically expire after a set number of tracks.
- Keeps auto-shuffle from placing duplicate tracks next to each other when avoidable.
- Runs a Smart Auto-DJ layer that learns server and per-user taste from likes, dislikes, and playback history, and can queue recommendations when the queue runs dry.
- Lets users save, list, load, and delete personal playlists, save the current queue as a playlist, and "steal" tracks from another listener's history.
- Tracks per-server leaderboards and play history, and can grab the currently playing track via DM.
- Cleans local, pre-cache, and Lavalink-adjacent cache state on the built-in 10-hour maintenance timer.
- Reports heartbeat, queue depth, backup depth, track state, and errors for Aria and SwarmPanel.

## Fleet Role

- Node: `harmonic`
- Database schema: `discord_music_harmonic`
- Panel visibility: SwarmPanel bot dashboard, queue controls, recovery views, and health feed.
- Aria visibility: Medic drift checks, voice timeout triage, stale node checks, and recovery probes.

## Tech Stack

- [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) 2.7
- [Wavelink](https://github.com/PythonistaGuild/Wavelink) 3.5 + a shared Lavalink node (youtube, lavasrc, sponsorblock plugins)
- aiomysql against the shared swarm MySQL/MariaDB instance
- Dockerized via the fleet's `docker-compose.yml`, with persistent log and cache volumes

## Guardrails

- Owner-only command access keeps the bot private.
- Cookie jars, tokens, and environment secrets are ignored and should never be committed.
- Queue recovery prefers the persisted live queue first, then the backup queue when the live queue leaks or fails.
